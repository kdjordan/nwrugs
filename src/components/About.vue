    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
      After more than 30 years serving Eugene, Oregon and beyond, NW Persian
      Rugs is closing its doors — but not before thanking the community that
      made it all possible.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
      As a family-owned and operated business, we’ve been honored to connect
      collectors and enthusiasts with an extensive collection of authentic,
      handmade Persian rugs.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
      From antique masterpieces to contemporary designs, each piece in our
      showroom is crafted from the finest wool and dyes sourced from around the
      world.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
      To express our gratitude, we’re hosting a massive closeout sale with
      unbeatable prices on our entire inventory.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
      Visit us in our downtown Eugene showroom any day of the week, from 11am to
      7pm. Our friendly, knowledgeable staff is here to help you find the
      perfect piece — and we offer delivery and in-home placement services, too.
      Thank you for over three decades of support.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl text-center text-gray-700 font-secondary text-xl">
