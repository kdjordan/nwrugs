# Vue 3 + Tailwind + AWS Amplify Project Structure

This project is a Vue 3 application styled with Tailwind CSS and intended for deployment using AWS Amplify.

## Main Entry Points
- The main application entry is [`src/main.js`](mdc:src/main.js).
- The root Vue component is [`src/App.vue`](mdc:src/App.vue).
- Static assets are located in the [`public/`](mdc:public/) directory.

## Tailwind CSS Integration
- Tailwind CSS is included as a dependency in [`package.json`](mdc:package.json).
- The Tailwind configuration file is typically named `tailwind.config.js` in the project root. If missing, create it to customize Tailwind settings.
- Tailwind is usually integrated via PostCSS, often configured in `postcss.config.js`.

## AWS Amplify Deployment
- This project is intended to be deployed using AWS Amplify. Amplify-specific configuration files (such as `aws-exports.js` or an `amplify/` directory) should be added after initializing Amplify in the project.
- For deployment, connect your repository to AWS Amplify Console and follow the setup instructions.

## Additional Notes
- All dependencies are managed via [`package.json`](mdc:package.json).
- Vite is used as the build tool, configured in [`vite.config.js`](mdc:vite.config.js).
